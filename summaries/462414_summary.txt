Chromosomal instability (CIN), a state in which cells undergo mitotic aberrations that generate chromosome copy number variations, generates aneuploidy and is thought to drive cancer evolution. Although associated with poor prognosis and reduced immune response, CIN generates aneuploidy-induced stresses that could be exploited for immunotherapies. In such contexts, macrophages and the CD47-SIRPα checkpoint are understudied. Here, CIN is induced pharmacologically induced in poorly immunogenic B16F10 mouse melanoma cells, generating persistent micronuclei and diverse aneuploidy while skewing macrophages towards an anti-cancer M1-like phenotype, based on RNA-sequencing profiling, surface marker expression and short-term antitumor studies. These results further translate to in vivo efficacy: Mice bearing CIN-afflicted tumors with wild-type CD47 levels survive only slightly longer relative to chromosomally stable controls, but long-term survival is maximized when combining macrophage-stimulating anti-tumor IgG opsonization and some form of disruption of the CD47-SIRPα checkpoint. Survivors make multi-epitope, de novo anti-cancer IgG that promote macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of CD47 knockout B16F10 cells and suppress tumoroids in vitro and growth of tumors in vivo . CIN does not greatly affect the level of the IgG response compared to previous studies but does significantly increase survival. These results highlight an unexpected therapeutic benefit from CIN when paired with maximal macrophage anti-cancer activity: an anti-cancer vaccination-like antibody response that can lead to more durable cures and further potentiate cell-mediated acquired immunity.
